# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing!
We welcome feedback, bug reports, and pull requests.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

* Use the **[GitHub Issues tab](../../issues)** to report bugs, request features, or ask questions.
* Please search existing issues before opening a new one to avoid duplicates.

### 2. Suggesting Improvements

* If you have ideas or feedback, open an **issue** with the label `enhancement` or `discussion`.
* Include as much context as possible to help others understand your suggestion.

### 3. Submitting Code

We follow the standard GitHub **fork-and-pull request workflow**:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear messages.
4. **Push** your branch to your fork.
5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** against the `main` branch.

> Please keep PRs focused and small when possible. This makes reviewing easier and speeds up merging.

### 4. Code Style

* Follow existing project conventions (naming, formatting, folder structure).
* If in doubt, match the style you see in the repo.

### 5. Questions

If you’re unsure about something, feel free to open an issue and start a discussion.
